# Custom-Web-Scraper
Portfolio
    • This project will scrape the Nutrition Value website for user provided food nutrition, at first the user must enter the type of food which we be used as an entry in the Nutrition Value website then it will return a list of the specifies types of the entered food to return more accurate data. In the end selenium will fetch the relevant data and deliver it the flask app that will construct a table for that data along with displaying the charts from the website.
    •   The hardest part was to know the user choice from the specific food type list as I had constructed the html form using a for loop and also the retuned data from selenium also was fetching all the types that had to be flexible as it might vary from type to another.
    • The easy part was constructing the gathered data.
    • Sometimes you might be forced to make a dummy webpage in order to only get the index of an item or an identifier that will difference it from other similar data.
    • As further improvement could be in providing more relevant data and tables as well as giving the user more control over the data.
